The same example as sits in gl-rs but with more wrapping
for the shaders and some other stuff.  This is just an
experimental repository to see how a basic game code could
be structured for a slightly higher level OpenGL binding.

Ignore that this repository exists, it's terrible OpenGL
handling for long.
